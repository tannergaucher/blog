**Takeaway: Time plus effort plus hope is not a strategy. You need to be systematic about how you learn.**

1. Find the sweetspot between active and passive learning.
2. Apply spacing to your learning.
3. Teach that you learn.
4. Keep a list of things you don't know.
5. Know how to rest and recover.

## Active Versus Passive Learning

- Passive learning is reading, watching courses, learning concepts
- Active learning is putting knowledge into practice
- Need to find the sweetspot between the two
- Ratio can and will change over time
- Early on, likely more conceptual
- Later on, usually more active

## Use Spacing

- Avoid cramming
- Better to spread learning out over time
- If taking a 7 hour course, better 7 days of 1 hour than 1 day of 7 hours
- Spreading out over time means revisiting. Forgetting and re-remembering

## Teaching Concepts that You've Just Learned

- Best way to test your knowledge of something you've just learned is to write a blog post about it
- Write about it, or explain concept to others
- Can shed light on grey areas that you think you know well

## Keep Track of All Things You Have Questions About

- Keep track of all your why?
- Don't always want to go down a rabit hole, switch contexts, when you have a question
- Keep a list of things that you don't understand
- Later on, persue these questions as time permits

## Know How to Rest and Recover

- Have a long-term perspective
- Don't let hustle get in the way of sleep
- Studies find that IQ drops with sleep deprivation
- Be just as disciplined about rest, breaks, recovery as you are about study

## My Thoughts

- Finding the sweetspot between active and passive is tough as a self-learner
- I probably spend too much time banging my head against things, compared to the amount of time I spend reading and learning. But I think that's both good and bad
